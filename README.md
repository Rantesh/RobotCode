# Team 3131 Steamworks Robot

Use this file to keep notes about the coding project. Please update this file with anything that will be useful to the team.

## Getting Started with GitHub

* Download GitHub desktop app with Internet Explorer (if not already on computer).  Will fail if using Microsoft Edge.
* Create an account at www.github.com
* Go to https://www.github.com/Rantesh/RobotCode and star and watch project.
* Request for Ryan to add you as a collaborator (you must accept Ryan's invite via email before you will have access).
* Follow the directions at https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/cloning-a-repository-from-github-desktop/ to clone the https://www.github.com/Rantesh/RobotCode to the computer if it isn't already there.


## How to work

Make sure to pull the latest version of the code from Github before you start working (you can use the "sync" feature in Github Desktop). 

Commit and push your changes to Github before leaving for the day. This will make sure everyone else has access to your latest changes when they start work on the code.

Update this readme.md file daily with a brief status update so other students coming in the following day know where the project is at.

## Procedures
* Updates (Every 2 weeks after kickoff)
** Eclipse
** FRC Update Suite
** RoboRio Firmware
** Reimage the RoboRio (And redownload the JRE!)
* For GitHub
** If we use multiple computers, sync before you start programming.
** Commit to master after successful tests.
** Update the readme and commit to master at the end of the day.
* For Programming Room
** Cleanup for 10 minutes at the end of the day.
** Plug in laptops at the end of the day you need to charge.

## Projects
* T-shirt Cannon Code
* Create Mini Java Class: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jQJItqsL7pO1Lro8Maw-NK7DqzCzYnVX13RtjORtHAw/edit?usp=sharing
* Find some way to drive the robot without the laptop

## To Do:
* *ADD IDEAS TO THIS LIST WHEN YOU THINK OF THEM*


## TEST TEST TEST

Get the software on the robot as early and often as possible! This will allow us to prove out and continuously improve our code as we go. It will also help mechanical and electrical to discover problems within their areas sooner. And its fun.
