# Getting Started with GitHub
* Download GitHub desktop app with Internet Explorer (if not already on computer).  Will fail if using Microsoft Edge.
* Create an account at www.github.com
* Go to https://www.github.com/Rantesh/RobotCode and star and watch project.
* Request for Ryan to add you as a collaborator (you must accept Ryan's invite via email before you will have access).
* Follow the directions at https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/cloning-a-repository-from-github-desktop/ to clone the https://www.github.com/Rantesh/RobotCode to the computer if it isn't already there.


# To Do:
* Autonomous
   * what should the robot do?
   * where should it start and what path should it take?
* SmartDashboard
* Have two (or more) different autonomous classes and toggle between them with the Smart Dashboard
  * may be a competitive advantage because would give more options for working with alliance partners
  * what if an alliance partner programs their autonomous mode to do what ours does? would be great to have a backup to score additional points with
* Use the ultrasonic sensor! (need to coordinate with electrical and mechanical)
* allow operator to switch between tank and arcide drive by pressing a button on the controller

# TEST TEST TEST

Get the software on the robot as early and often as possible! This will allow us to prove put and continuously improve our code as we go.
